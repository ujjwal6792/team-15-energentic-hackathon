# Utility-Led Solarization Agent

A Utility-Led Solarization Agent is an intelligent digital assistant designed to support and accelerate the transition to green energy, led by utility providers.

```
It serves as a personalized guide for users by:
1. Educating them on the benefits of green energy and solar adoption.
2. Connecting them with relevant solar energy providers and available government or utility-led subsidy programs.
3. Assisting them in navigating the process of obtaining a solar connection.
4. Promoting awareness of programs like the Demand Flexibility Program, encouraging users to shift their energy usage patterns toward more sustainable practices.

### Challenges and Learnings

The backend tech stack was quite new to us, which made it both challenging and rewarding. We gained hands-on experience with the **Beckn protocol** and deepened our understanding of the **green energy domain**.
